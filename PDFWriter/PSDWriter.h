a process by which the R,G, and B values are multiplied by the alpha. Setting this

If you are using NSImages and not CGImages, use the following code to convert to CGImageRefs:

    NSImage* yourImage;
    CGImageSourceRef source = CGImageSourceCreateWithData((CFDataRef)[yourImage TIFFRepresentation], NULL);
    CGImageRef imageRef = CGImageSourceCreateImageAtIndex(source, 0, NULL);

If you prefer, you can setup PSDLayers by yourself
and put them in the PSDWriter.layers array, but this method automatically creates the flattenedData,
an image that is a flattened preview of the layered PSD. If you populate the layer objects yourself,
you need to provide the flattened image data yourself. 

Note: Having layers partially off the edge of the canvas is not currently supported. 

@param image The image to be added. Does not need to be the same size as the document, but it cannot be larger.
@param name The name you'd like to give the layer.
@param opacity The opacity of the layer, from [0-1]
@param offset The offset of the layer within the document. Use this to position layers within the PSD.

Note: You cannot call this function multiple times. After calling createPSDData and getting the document data,
you should discard the PSDWriter object. This function is destructive and deletes the information you provided
in the layers array to conserve memory as it writes the PSD data.
