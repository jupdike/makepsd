@interface NSMutableData (PSDAdditions)

/** Allows you to append a numeric value to an NSMutableData object and pad it to any length. 

For example, we could say [data appendValue: 2 withLength: 5], and 00002 would be written
into the data object. Very useful for writing to file formats that have header structures
that require a certain number of bytes be used for a certain value. i.e. PSD and TIFF 

 @param value The value to append
 @param length The number of bytes that should be used to store the value. The value will be padded
to length bytes regardless of the number of bytes required to store it.

@interface NSData (PSDAdditions)

/** Takes packedBits data and prints out a description of the packed contents by
running the decode operation and explaining via NSLog how the data is being 
decoded. Useful for checking that packedBits data is correct. */
- (NSString *)packedBitsDescription;

/** A special version of packedBits which will take the data and pack every nth
value. 

This is important for PSDWriter because it's necessary to encode R, then G,
then B, then A data - so we essentially start at offset 0, skip 4, then do offset 1,
skip 4, etc... to compress the data with very minimal memory footprint. 

For normal packbits just to skip = 1 

 @param range The range within the data object that should be encoded. Useful
for specifying a non-zero starting offset to get a certain channel encoded.
 @param skip The number of bytes to advance as the data is encoded. Skip = 1 will
encode every byte, skip = 4 will encode every fourth byte, and so on.
